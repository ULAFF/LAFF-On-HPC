# LAFF-On-HPC
Repository for LAFF-On High Performance Computing

In this repository, we are building materials for a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) titled "LAFF-On High-Performance Computing (LAFF-On-HPC)."  While being developed for the MOOC, the notes and activities can equally well be used for other educational purposes, outside the context of the MOOC.  An overview of the planned materials are described in a paper we have submitted to EduPar'18:  

Devangi N. Parikh, Jianyu	Huang, Margaret E.	Myers, Robert A.	van de Geijn.  Learning from Optimizing Matrix-Matrix Multiplication.  EduPar'18.  Submitted.

The notes can be found in LAFF-On-HPC.pdf.  If you clone the repository, and open that PDF locally from within the directory LAFF-On-HPC, then the links in the PDF should take you to the various activities in the subdirectory Assignments.
